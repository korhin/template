Testing
*******

Ethers uses a large suite of test cases to help ensure the library is as
complete, backwards compatible and correct as possible and pass
regression as new features are added.

Many of the test cases are created procedurally.

**@TODO:**
    Explain more here on how to run and add testcases.

**@TODO:**
    Post links to the testcases on IPFS (the generated test cases can takes hours to
    generate and are too large to check into GitHub)
